  "Pure-function domain logic for the office-machinery plant-operations
  coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification, shipment-
  quantity recompute, product-type validation, dielectric-withstand-
  test plausibility validation, defect-rate plausibility validation,
  and draft maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination record
  construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/officemach`-style capability library to
  wrap (verified: no such repo exists). The domain logic therefore
  lives here as pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by
  `officemach.governor` -- the same 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline every sibling actor's own registry establishes (e.g.
  `watchmfg.registry/shipment-quantity-exceeded?` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2652`, and `elecequipmfg.registry` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2710`): never trust a proposal's own
  self-reported quantity/status when the inputs needed to recompute it
  independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real plant-operations system. It builds the DRAFT record
  a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled maintenance window, a
  coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating assembly/test-bench
  equipment or dispatching a real freight carrier, and never the act
  of issuing a safety-certification mark (this actor NEVER does any of
  those -- see README `What this actor does NOT do`).

  SCOPE: ISIC 2817 covers manufacture of office machinery and
  equipment (except computers and peripheral equipment) -- typewriters,
  calculators, cash registers, photocopiers, duplicating machines,
  postage meters, and adding machines -- precision assembly and
  test-bench lines producing finished non-computer office equipment.
  This actor coordinates the back-office record-keeping around that
  plant (production-batch logging, maintenance scheduling, safety-
  concern flagging, shipment coordination) -- it never touches the
  assembly/test-bench equipment directly, and it never stands in for
  the certification body that issues safety-certification marks (e.g.
  UL listing or CE marking under applicable electrical-safety/
  machinery directives).")
